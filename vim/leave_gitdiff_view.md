# Leave Gdiff view but keep windows open

I'm using sometimes the `Gdiff` view from [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).

But how leave the view easily without closing the window. Simply use the
command `:diffoff`. You will still have the windows splited but you will
not be anymore into the diff mode.
