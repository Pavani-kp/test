# List tables privileges

I wanted to see privileges of tables in my redshift database.

I've use this SQL to see the list :

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
    (
    SELECT
        schemaname
        ,objectname
        ,usename
        ,HAS_TABLE_PRIVILEGE(usrs.usename, fullobj, 'select') AS sel
        ,HAS_TABLE_PRIVILEGE(usrs.usename, fullobj, 'insert') AS ins
        ,HAS_TABLE_PRIVILEGE(usrs.usename, fullobj, 'update') AS upd
        ,HAS_TABLE_PRIVILEGE(usrs.usename, fullobj, 'delete') AS del
        ,HAS_TABLE_PRIVILEGE(usrs.usename, fullobj, 'references') AS ref
    FROM
        (
        SELECT schemaname, 't' AS obj_type, tablename AS objectname, schemaname + '.' + tablename AS fullobj FROM pg_tables
        WHERE schemaname not in ('pg_internal')
        UNION
        SELECT schemaname, 'v' AS obj_type, viewname AS objectname, schemaname + '.' + viewname AS fullobj FROM pg_views
        WHERE schemaname not in ('pg_internal')
        ) AS objs
        ,(SELECT * FROM pg_user) AS usrs
    ORDER BY fullobj
    )
WHERE (sel = true or ins = true or upd = true or del = true or ref = true)
AND schemaname='public';
```
